# README

This is a fork of the original smallchecklist. I have changed the original quite a bit, with little of the original code remaining. The script uses JSON files located in the `tabs/` folder. Settings to change the appearance can be found in the `config/config.json` file.

The folder layout must be followed or errors will occur:
